## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- The AWD-Fundamentals project is a simple multipage website designed to demonstrate the foundational principles of web design and JavaScript programming. The website consists of two pages: a Landing Page and a Demo Page. These pages highlight the structure, styling, and interactivity possible with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Showcase the basics of web design, including file structure, styling, and responsiveness.
- Demonstrate key JavaScript concepts:
Variables: Storing and manipulating data.
Input/Output: Accepting user input and displaying results.
Conditionals: Decision-making logic.
Looping: Automating repetitive tasks.
- HTML	Used to structure the content of the website, including headings, buttons, forms, and links.
CSS	Used to style the website, making it visually appealing and responsive. All styles are managed through external CSS files.
JavaScript	Adds interactivity to the Demo Page, handling user input, processing logic, and dynamically updating the content.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
